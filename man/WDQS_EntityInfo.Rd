\usage{
WDQS_EntityInfo(entity, langsorder = "en", wikilangs = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{entity}{The Wikidata entity to search for properties. Only one entity
is allowed.}

\item{langsorder}{Order of languages in which the information will be
returned, separated with '|'. If no information exists in the first language,
next is used. This parameter is mandatory, at least one language is required,
default, 'en'.
Note: sometimes not label in any language of langsorder is assigned to an
entity, so an additional search is used to obtain almost one label for it
(?entitylab) with LIMIT 1.}

\item{wikilangs}{List of languages to limit the search of Wikipedia pages,
using "|" as separator. Wikipedias pages are returned in same order as
languages in this parameter. If wikilangs='' the function returns Wikipedia
pages in any language, not sorted.}
